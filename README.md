Reactor
<img src="./logo.jpg"/>
Reactor will be a script hub dedicated STRICTLY TO REACT JS Simliar to Code Pen but 100% React , Along with a NPM list for any type of Development . And you have a UI built to store and deploy all the componenets you want to add to a deck. As this app evolves this readme will become more dynamic. This is a rough over view , and as we all know the best ideas dont come until later on.

Users may search , browse , sell, trade, post , use and create React Components, Views, Widgets, along with browse libraries of the most trending Npms.

PERSONAL NPM COMING SOON FOR YOUR OWN COMPONENT LIBARY

This is for React Only, Coming Soon , Reactor X Npm Install so you may import all of its components or views from a Json package.

Reactor is broken down into 4 separate portals .

Components
Widgets
Exclusive Scripts
NPM Hub ( Users may post Npms for others to use , I will personally add the most main stream ones as well , so this will act as a directory to anything related to React Development)
The listed scripts will have a descritpion , dependency's  or any REQUIRED nmps , data , author , rating , img, source code <css/Js> , Like, Share , Git Hub Links , Ect.

The Components will be separated by type and rating.

KEY FEATURES

The R3-Deck Builder

Users profile UI will be built around a Deck building concept . The deck will be a storage of the users collected Components and Npms. It will be a swiftly navigated and well orginzed list of all the components the user chose to add to his deck. The deck will be displayed along with a tool bar to quickly transfer the components source code to any editor , or he will be given a PERSONAL NMP , in which they may access the components through direct import and utilization of the components class name. In a sense this deck will act as a template to build react applications with ease . Since the deck will be stored inside a Redux store, they may access this deck anywhere via internet. As all of the components will all have a button to quickly add them directly to there deck. React is completely free and will remain free as far as the main concepts.

Script Stores

Reactor will in the other hand allow more experienced devs to create exclusive scripts and start there own script bank, or personal store. Scripts that are deemed exclusive will be posted through reactors library , but my only be accessed through payment to the dev them self. Or the exclusive scripts may be views standalone in the exclusive scripts section.

Show off your skills

The Users will be given the option to create new components to add the browse-able library for all other devs to obtain acess to . There compents may be rated , shared , and added to other devs decks. Developers will be able to gain rating though there evolution in the reactor community. Top devs profiles that maintain high state of involvement  , and be granted the ability to be contacted by recruiters. Reactors admin will be sharing developers profiles in professional industry of recruiters and clients.

A new react js isolated community

Reactor is meant to isolate React Js and draw its developers into shared media source. This will in return give this new langue a cutting edge acceleration of tech advancement.

Simple... Now lets fuel React with infinte, resuable , cutting edge source codes. This allows developers to automatically have access to the most advance scripts in react , allowing them to build on the top of the max potential complexity available as a community. Along with offering a New type of UI for react developers to build a reusable code deck and perfect there own template to reach elevated states of tech engineering.

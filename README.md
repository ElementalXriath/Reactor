# R3actor


 R3actor will be a hub dedicated strictly to react. Users may search , browse , sell, trade,  post , use and create React Components ,
 Views , Widgets and Premium Scripts. This is for React Only ... only real developers allowed :) Comming Soon , Reactor Npm Install so you may import components or views from a package.
 
 Reactor is broken down into 4 seperate portals . 
 
 - Views
 - Components
 - Widgets
 - Exclusive Scripts
 
 Each portal contains an orginized list of components created by other users and developers alike.
 
 You may add a listed script to your R3Deck , ( a user profile feature where you may store access to your favorite scripts).
 
 !!! The R3Deck will be equipped with a powerful UI allowing easy tranfer of code from the deck to editor.
 
 You may also create  ,Views , Widgets and new Compoents and Add them to R3actors Libary. So others may view and add to there deck . 
 
 The listed scripts will have a descritpion , dependices or any REQUIRED nmps , data , author , rating , img, soruce code <css/Js> , Like, Add to deck , 
 notes .
 
 Scripts may be posted as exclusive and they must be bought to get source code. They may veb viewed from any portal but they may only be 
 added to your deck by purchase.
 
 Decks may be saved as Templates to build with react. You may post your entire deck as a Template for others to add to there deck list.
 
 Simple... Now lets fuel React with infinte source codes. This allows developers to automaticaly have access to the most
 advance scripts in react , allowing them to build on the top of the max potenial complexity. Until React is ither maximized 
 or we come to find its truly Supurior.

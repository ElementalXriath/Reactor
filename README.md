# R3actor


 R3actor will be a script hub dedicated STRICTLY TO REACT JS. 
 
 Users may search , browse , sell, trade,  post , use and create React Components, Views, Widgets, along with browse a libaries of the most trending Npms.
 
This is for React Only,  Comming Soon , ReactorX Npm Install so you may import all of its components or views from a Json package.
 

 Reactor is broken down into 4 seperate portals . 
 

 - Components
 - Widgets
 - Exclusive Scripts
 - NPM Hub ( Users may post Npms for others to use , I will personaly add the most main stream ones as well , so this will act as a directory to anything related to React Development)

 
 
The listed scripts will have a descritpion , dependices or any REQUIRED nmps , data , author , rating , img, soruce code <css/Js> , Like, Share , Git Hub Links , Ect.

The Components will be seperated by type and rating. 

KEY FEATURE. 

The R3-Deck Builder. Users profile UI will be built around a Deck building concept . The deck will be a storage of the users collected Components and Npms. It will be a swiftly navigated and well orginzed list of all the components the user chose to add to his deck. The deck will be displayed along with a tool bar to quicly tranfer the components source code to any editor , or he will be given a PERSONAL NMP , in which they may access the components through direct import and utilization of the components class name. In a sense this deck will act as a template to build react applications with ease . Since the deck will be stored inside a Redux store, they may access this deck anywhere via internt. As all of the components will all have a button to quicly add them directlty to there deck.  React is completly free and will remain free as far as the main concepts. 

Reactor will in the other hand allow more experienced devs to script exclusive scripts and start there own script bank. Scripts that are deemed exclusive will be posted throught reactors libary , but my only be accessed through payment to the dev them selfs. Or the exlcuise scripts may be views standalone in the exclusive scripts section.

The Users will be given the option to create new components to add the browsable libary for all other devs to obtain acess to . There compents may be rated , shared , and added to other devs decks. Developers will be able to gain rating though there evloution in the reactor community. Top devs profiles will mainting high state , and be granted the abilty to be contacted by recruiters. Reactors admin will be sharing developers profiles in professional industry of recruiters and clients. 

Reactor is meant to isolate React Js and draw its developers into shared media source. This will in return fuel React Js.
 
 Simple... Now lets fuel React with infinte, resuable , cutting edge source codes. This allows developers to automaticaly have access to the most advance scripts in react , allowing them to build on the top of the max potenial complexity as community. Along with offering a New type of UI for react developers to build a reusable code deck  and perfect there own template to reach elevated states of tech engineering.

<br />
Reactor will be a script hub, social point, recruiting site, and Developer Tool dedicated <b>STRICTLY TO REACT JS.</b> 

<h4> As well as a developement tool for React devs. It will be desinged to reduce the amount of time it takes to code in react , as well as increase effecincey. It allows devs to build personal templates and re usable libaeries by creating decks out of components.</h4>
  
 This is a 100% React social platform, designed to accurate Reacts potential in the tech world as well as provide developers a new type of NPM AND UI tool to make coding in React obsolete in speed, complexity and understanding. 2 minds are better then 1 and 2 million better then 1 million. This is a product in early stages of evolution , but I have little doubt It find its place in the halls of legends :) I am already using the UI on my  version control to program with personally. It is faster, cleaner , smarter , and this personal experience I have with its prototype has made me certain it will change the game for react.
 
 A UI built to store and deploy all the components there is to offer from a network of developers/ Simply click add to deck on any components that is on the network a new concept we have came up with... a PERSONAL NMP AND KEY. As this app evolves this readmes will become more dynamic. This is a rough over view , and as we all know the best ideas don't come until later on.

Users may :

All React Related Views, Widgets, Routers , Templates, along with browse libraries of the most trending Inns and components React has to offer.

PERSONAL NPM COMING SOON FOR YOUR OWN COMPONENT LIBRARY = Reactor Gem for your own deck of components. May not be clear to you yet , but ill be sure its very clear very soon.




<H1>KEY FEATURES</h1>

<h1>The R3-Deck Builder</h1> ( Save all you favortie components to build UIS )

Users profile UI will be built around a Deck building concept . The deck will be a storage of the users collected Components and Inns. It will be a swiftly navigated and well organized list of all the components the user chose to add to his deck. The deck will be displayed along with a tool bar to quickly transfer the components source code to any editor , or he will be given a PERSONAL NMP , in which they may access the components through direct import and utilization of the components class name. In a sense this deck will act as a template to build react applications with ease . Since the deck will be stored inside a Redux store, they may access this deck anywhere via internet. As all of the components will all have a button to quickly add them directly to there deck. React is completely free and will remain free as far as the main concepts.

<h1>Script Stores</h1>

Reactor will in the other hand allow more experienced devs to create exclusive scripts and start there own script bank, or personal store. Scripts that are deemed exclusive will be posted through reactors library , but my only be accessed through payment to the dev them self. Or the exclusive scripts may be views standalone in the exclusive scripts section.

<h1>Show off your skills</h1>

The Users will be given the option to create new components to add the browse-able library for all other devs to obtain access to . There components may be rated , shared , and added to other devs decks. Developers will be able to gain rating though there evolution in the reactor community. Top devs profiles that maintain high state of involvement  , and be granted the ability to be contacted by recruiters. Reactors admit will be sharing developers profiles in professional industry of recruiters and clients.

<h1>A Social Platfrom for React Component Developmenmt</h1>

Reactor is meant to isolate React Js and draw its developers into shared media source. This will in return give this new langue a cutting edge acceleration of tech advancement.

Simple... Now lets fuel React with infinite, reusable , cutting edge source codes. This allows developers to automatically have access to the most advance scripts in react , allowing them to build on the top of the Max potential complexity available as a community. Along with offering a New type of UI for react developers to build a reusable code deck and perfect there own template to reach elevated states of tech engineering.

<h1>A Reactor Create App
</h1>
This npm will come pre routed and pre wired to a redux store. Simply run npm install reactor app , the home page will be a form to submit to open the redux store and choose you landing template. The app js is already wired with react dom and links. The file structure already has a set up to build from seed out keeping the data one way and immutable. :) The file structure can only be damaged by bad practices. The index fills in the views already have comments on how to build views/ components and there is a list of import options.

Please excuse my spelling ATM IM doing this at a very very rapid pace, and this read me is more for my personal notes then anything else.
